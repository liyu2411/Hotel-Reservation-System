# Hotel-Reservation-System
A simple system that allows customers to make reservations at a hotel.

 Key Features of a Hotel Reservation System:

Room Availability & Booking Management: The system keeps track of room inventory and shows the availability of rooms. Guests can select and reserve a room based on the dates of their stay.

Online Booking: Many HRS platforms offer an online booking engine, allowing guests to book rooms directly from the hotel's website or third-party platforms, including mobile apps.

Guest Profile Management: The system stores guest data, such as personal information, booking history, and preferences, to provide a personalized experience during future visits.

Payment Processing: An integrated payment gateway ensures secure transactions, handling deposits, cancellations, and refunds. It may also allow different payment methods (credit cards, digital wallets, etc.).
