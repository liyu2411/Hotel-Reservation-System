# Hotel-Reservation-System
A simple system that allows customers to make reservations at a hotel.

Explanation of the code:
Room Structure: Defines a Room structure to store details such as room number, reservation status, guest name, and stay duration.
Display Rooms: A function to display available rooms.
Reserve Room: A function to reserve a room by entering the room number, guest name, and stay duration. It checks if the room is already reserved.
Check Availability: A function to check if a specific room is available or reserved.
Menu System: A simple menu allows users to interact with the system, where they can view available rooms, reserve a room, or check availability.
How to use:
The user can choose options from the menu to either view available rooms, reserve a room, or check if a specific room is available.
When reserving a room, the user needs to provide the guest name and the duration of stay.
The system will update the status of the room accordingly.
This is just a basic implementation to get you started. You can enhance it by adding more features like room categories, pricing, or saving the reservation data in a file.
